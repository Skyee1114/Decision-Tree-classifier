I builded the project to determine whether a patient has COVID-19 using a decision tree classifier.
I imported data from a CSV file named task1 using Pandas library and converted "Y" and "N" values 1 and 0.
I built the decision tree model using Sklearn library and split the data into Training_data and Test_data using the train_test_split function.
The split ratio is 0.2 because it is the most suitable rate according to the experience.
Next, I trained a decision tree model with 2 * number of features as max_depth.
It means there are 2 * num_features of decreminant lines.
Finally, I validated with Test_data and outputed the accuracy.
As you know, we lack data and due to that, the accuracy is not high.
Thank you for your kind attention.
